# Fake Data âœ¨

Our project harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate objective data on nuanced topics that are typically difficult to quantify. By leveraging the vast knowledge base and advanced analytical capabilities of LLMs, we aim to provide insights and data that would otherwise be unattainable. Unlike subjective human opinions, the data generated by LLMs is derived from comprehensive training on diverse internet sources, ensuring a more balanced and objective perspective. This project seeks to bridge the gap between subjective analysis and objective data, offering a new way to understand and measure the importance and relevance of various topics across different domains.

The first phase of our project focuses on generating relevance scores for a wide range of topics using LLMs. This involves instructing the LLM to evaluate the relevance of a given topic on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies maximum relevance and 0 indicates no relevance at all. For instance, if we were to analyze the topic of baseball, the LLM would provide a relevance score based on its significance and impact within a specified context or timeframe. This approach allows us to quantify the importance of topics in an objective manner, providing valuable insights for researchers, analysts, and decision-makers. By automating the relevance scoring process, we ensure consistency, scalability, and a reduction in bias, making it a powerful tool for data-driven analysis.
